# Hangman
INTRODUCTION
Background: This project consists of creating a console application representing the Hangman game.
Why should you do this project? The aim is, on one hand, to put in practice the language elements seen so far in 
the lessons. On the other, to practice how to handle complexity.
What should you deliver? You will deliver a platform-independent dotnet 6 console application written in C#.

YOUR TASK 
What needs to be done? 
Read the problem description. Sketch-up in a piece of paper the flow of the 
entire application. This way you can get a high-level overview of the application. 
Try to understand the different parts of the application: user interaction (how 
the user will input data), presentation (how the game will be shown on the 
screen), the game rules (winning and losing conditions), etc. 

How to work? 
To avoid the stress caused by complexity, try to split the application into pieces 
(methods) that you can solve independently. This way you can focus on one 
thing at a time.

ASSESSMENT AND FEEDBACK
Assessment will take place according to these criteria

For Godkänt (G) the following requirements must be met:
● The application must have a list of at least 10 words, from which one 
random word will be used every time you play.
● The user must be able to see which letters he has already guessed.
● The user must be able to see how many attempts are left
● Letters’ cases don’t matter. This means, A and a are equivalent.

For Väl Godkänt (VG) the following requirements must be met:
● All the requirements for Godkänt.
● The user must be able to play again if desired
● The “cool input” feature must be implemented


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Hangman game consists of guessing a word in 6 attempts.
On every attempt the player guesses one letter and:
1- If the letter is in the word, all occurrences of the letter in the word are revealed to the player.
2- Otherwise, the player loses one attempt
In any case, the guessed letter is added to a list of used letters, for now on, usedLetters.

The user interface
The word to be guessed is displayed to the user with underscores if a letter is not revealed yet, or the letter itself otherwise. 
All positions must be separated by a space. For example, if the word is “foo” but only the “f” is revealed (guessed correctly 
by the user), the output must be “f _ _”. 

The usedLetters must be shown separated by a space to improve readability. E.g. “a b c” instead of “abc”
The attempts left must be displayed with a meaningful message. E.g “Attempts left: 3”
Every time a new move is made, the console must be cleared. This way the game looks more natural.

The input
The user must be able to input his guess through the console, confirmed by pressing the “enter” key. If the user types more 
than one character, only the first one must be considered. If the user types a blank line (hits enter without writing anything) 
then the input should be ignored. This means, it never happened.

The cool input (Requirement for VG)
When the user types a letter, two things can happen:
1- Confirm by pressing the key “enter”
2- Discarded by pressing the key “backspace”
When a letter is discarded it must be removed from the console and the user must be allowed to type again a letter.

Messages
When the user wins, a freely chosen message must be displayed. E.g. “Congrats, you rock”
When the user loses, a freely chosen message is displayed indicating that he ran out of attempts. In addition, the word 
must be revealed. See Example output section.

Playing again (Requirement for VG)
When the user finishes a game (regardless of whether he won or not), he should be allowed to play a new game. E.g. 
“Would you like to play again? y/n”. If the user says yes/ja then another game starts. If the user says no/nej then the 
application terminates. Otherwise (neither yes nor no) the input must be ignored until a valid answer is provided by the 
user.
